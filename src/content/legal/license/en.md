Mosquito Alert is a citizen science system that allows collaboration among various actors in the study, monitoring and control of mosquitoes that are vectors of diseases such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya or West Nile fever. The Mosquito Alert app (formerly Tigatrapp) is an application for mobile phones and tablets that allows anyone to participate in Mosquito Alert.

The Mosquito Alert app has been developed by the following institutions: the Spanish National Research Council’s Blanes Center for Advanced Studies (CEAB-CSIC), the Center for Ecological Research and Forest Applications (CREAF), Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) and the Catalan Institute for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA).

The source code for the Mosquito Alert app is available on the project website at [www.mosquitoalert.com](http://www.mosquitoalert.com/en/).
