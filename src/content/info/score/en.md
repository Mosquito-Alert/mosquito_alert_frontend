## SCORE INFO

Actions taken in Mosquito Alert have recognition and rewards in the form of points. The number of points per report varies depending on the information provided and its quality.

The maximum points that can be obtained per report are:

- Invasive *Aedes* Mosquito: 20 points
- Common mosquito: 14 points
- Storm drain breeding site: 20 points
- Other breeding site in a public area: 16 points


In addition, there are extra bonuses for the first mosquito of the season, the first report of the day or for participating frequently. When you reach a specific number of reports, you not only get extra points, but you get a special trophy. There are different trophies according to the milestones reached.

Those reports that are sent as a mosquito but turn out not to be mosquitoes, according to expert validation, will not earn points. A photo that does not allow experts to identify the mosquito or breeding place will not be scored either.

The accumulation of points will allow you to go up a **level**:

- (1) Novice (beginner)
- (2) Contributor (contributor)
- (3) Expert (expert)
- (4) Master (master)
- (5) Grandmaster (grandmaster)


These icons indicate the level reached:
